# CornModel
A Minecraft Model Reader for Unity written in C#, which can be easily merged into and used by other Minecraft-related Unity projects.

## Features
__CornModel__ provides almost full support for Minecraft: Java Edition's block json model format, reads block models and blockstate models from json files and  builds them into model data. Face-culling data is contained in the loaded model data, so it is possible to build optimized large chunks of block geometries with all hidden faces culled.
